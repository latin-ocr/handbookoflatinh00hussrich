PREFACE v

The main space above them is occupied by the regular alpha-
betical list of complete groups. Each member of such a group
is given a separate number to distinguish it. This is followed
by its case or tense, as it may be, the word from which it comes,
and its translation. The translation is, however, merely for the
purpose of identifying the homonym. It must not be supposed
that it will exactly suit every passage in which the word occurs.

The different classes of homonyms are discussed in the Intro-
duction at pp. xix-xxxi. The word lzomonym is there taken in
its most general sense. But in the alphabetical lists this sense
of the word has had to be, to some extent, restricted. To have
inserted all kinds of homonyms in the lists, would have made
the book too large, and not appreciably increased its usefulness.
The selection that it contains is made on the lines of certain
natural classes, into which homonyms fall. By this means it
is thought that none of the more interesting ones have been
omitted.

Class Ι. (described on pp. xix—xxiv), where the homonyms
are inflectional variations of the same word, has been entirely
omitted (with the exception of some words noticed in Appen-
dix Α., pp. 173-177).

Class II. (described on pp. xxv-xxviii), where the homonyms
are different wordS‚ but derived from the same stem, has been
in part listed and in part omitted. This class falls naturally
into a number of subdivisions. Those that have been inserted
in the list are instances where ε -

(1) A noun or adjective becomes a preposition.

(2) A noun or adj. becomes a noun (with a different nom.).

(3) A noun, adj„ or pronoun becomes a conjunction.

(4) A pronoun becomes an adverb.
