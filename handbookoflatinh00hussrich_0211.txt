APPENDIX 175

VERBS

Some groups and pairs of homonyms‚ that are produced within the inflec-
tion of a verb by a form from one of its systems coinciding with a form
from another, are outlined in the Introduction, pp. xxiii, xxiv. These pairs
comprise far the greater number of such cases of coincidence. Other pairs
that are formed more rarely are entered in the Alphabetical List as far as
they occur in actual use. These rarer coinciding forms are likewise found
at certain regular places in the verb-inflection, which it may be interesting
to specify.

PRESENT AND PERFECT SYSTEMS

In the first conj. coincidences between these systems can occur in only
two places, and they are also practically limited to the one verb z'uvo‘. In
this verb the two pres. subj. pass, forms, z'uvbrz's, z'uvZ’re, form two pairs of
homonyms (or more strictly homographs) with the pf. and fut. pf. ind. act.
forms, ι’ῑῖυένε and z'ziverz's.

The second conj. has the same two pairs in a few of its verbs. Generally
the stem-vowel is lengthened in the pf. so that two pairs of homographs
arise. This is seen on comparing vz'slbrz's and vidbre with videris and
vidssre. One pair of homonyms and one pair of homographs would on the
other hand be produced by such a verb as respondeffl, whose stem—vowel
remains unchanged. The second conj. differs from the first in that its two
forms from the present stem are not from the subj.‚ but from the ind„ impv.‚
and inf. Coincidences between the present and pf. system are thus rather
more frequent in the second than in the first conj. ”

In the third conj. the groups of homonyms that may arise are five in
’ number. They have been already outlined (Introduction, pp. xxiii, xxiv),
and form three groups of pure homonyms and two of homographs. In a
few verbs the stem-vowel os the pf. is lengthened and then all five groups
become homographs as, for example, in eme? or lego‘. These homographs,
such as emit, Zmil,- legere, lngre, have been given a place in the list.
The coincidences of verbs whose stem is unchanged in the pf. aS‚ for
example, those of contendff, have been omitted, because these verbs are so
much more numerous.

Two -ἰᾶ verbs of the third conj„ fodit? and sugifi, also make sets of homo-
graphs like ech. They differ, however, from it in that their fut. pf.
(fbderis) and pf. (fo‘dbre) coincide with their pres. ind. and impV. pass,
only (foderis, ·re)‚ and not with their sut. ind. pass. (fodic‘ris, -re). In a
verb like emb all these forms would have the same spelling.
