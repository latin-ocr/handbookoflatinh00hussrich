APPENDIX

A. ADDITIONAL HOMONYMS FORMED BY THE
INFLECTION OF A SINGLE WORD

IN the Introduction, pp. xix-xxiv, instances are given where forms are
duplicated in the course of the inflection of ordinary Latin words. These
are all standard, classica] forms and are most of them in common use. All
other instances of duplication of form within the inflection of a word, that
are not thus outlined in the Introduction, have been entered in the Alpha-
betical List, pp. 1-172. This is, of course, provided that they are found in
actual use. These smaller groups of coinciding forms generally contain
some earlier or more unusual word-form. The groups themselves may be
conveniently shown in a tabular arrangement as follows: —

Gen. Sing. (in its earlier ending in -a‘s) = Acc. Pl.
samilz'ds familia-s

SECOND DECLENSION

Nom. Sing. (in its earlier ending in -os) = Ace. Pl.
