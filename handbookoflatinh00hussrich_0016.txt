xii INTRODUCTION

tration of this point, “A picture of a physician will not be
able to carry on a physician’s practice3 it is only a physician
homonymically.'’ In the definition of both synonyms and
homonyms, Aristotle has thus quite a different point of view
from ours. ’

He, however, employs the modern grammatical sense of these
terms, without redefining them, in Rhet. III. 2, 7. Here the
homonym and synonym are evidently understood as words.
In this passage he puts homonyms among the words that help
the sophist in playing his tricks 3 synonyms among those that
are useful to the poet (τῶν δ’ ὀνομάτων τῷ μὲν σοφιστῇ ὁμωνυμίαι
χρήσιμοι, παρὰ ταύτας γὰρ κακουργεῖ, τῷ ποιητῇ δὲ συνωνυμιάι).
As an example of two homonyms of this verbal sort Aristotle
gives (Etlz. Nic. V. 2) κλείς, meaning either ‘key' or ‘collar-
bone ’ ; and as an example of two synonyms, the two verbs of
motion, πορεύεσθαι and βαδίζειν (Rlzet. III. 2, 7).

The later Greek rhetoricians tell us little about homonyms,
except that they cause ambiguity (or amphibolia, as it is termed
by them). Theon illustrates this figure by the phrase (Spengel,
Rlz. Gr. II. 129) ἐκ παιδὸς μὴ εἶναι μαρτυρίαν, where a doubt
arises whether παιδός means child, or son, or slave. Another
of the writers on rhetoric instances ζεῦγος βοῶν ἤλαυνεν. In
this it is doubtful whether βοῶν is intended to 'mean slzeuting·
or eff oxen. The ambiguity of homonyms is likewise noticed
by Quintilian (Inst. Orat. VII. 9, 2): singula affirunt errb-
rem cnm plnribus rebus aut hominibus eadem appelldtib est
(ὁμωνυμία dicitur) ut Gallus, avem, an gentem, an nh'men, an

sortnnam corporis significet incertum est.
Under a figure called trdductz‘b a certain kind of homonym is
discussed by the Auctor ad Herennium. His words are (4, 20) ;
