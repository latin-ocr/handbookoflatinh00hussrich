1 76 APPENDIX

In the fourth conj. comperio‘ (the late odi5) and venio* are the only verbs
in which forms from the present and the perfect system coincide. Venio·
(and odz'o‘) supplies three pairs of homographs vent* υέηἵ, venit υὲηἰί, vem'-
mus venimus. Comperio‘, having its stem unchanged, gives pure homo-
nyms in the first two pairs and a homograph in the last.

The third conj. thus shows the greatest number of coincidences‚ namely
five, between its present and its perfect system. The fourth conj. comes
next with three. The first and second conis. follow with two each. The
five pairs of coinciding forms of the third conj. show the five different end-
ings -ῖ, -z't, -imus, ire (mre) and -erz's (ὠνὰς). Verbs of the other conis,
show no other endings, but merely share these with one another. The
first and second conjs. each take -ἑνε and -erz's (-e3rz's). The fourth conj.
takes the remaining three, -ῖ, -z't‚ and -z‘mus (-z'mus).

The forms of the perfect system usually have one fixed way in which
they are spelled. In some instances‚ however, a pf. that regularly ends
its stem with a v may omit this v and contract the resulting adjacent
vowels. A common instance of this, with the ending -(v)crz's, is given in
the Introduction, p. xxiv. Besides this instance, the z'v-pfs. (fourth, rarely
third conj.) may allow other contracted forms which are homonymous with
presents. Pett, petit, and petimus are examples of such pfs.‚ which by con·
traction thus come to coincide with forms from the present system.

PRESENT AND SUPINE SYSTEMS

The most frequent coincidences between the present and supine system
are those that were noticed at p. xxiv of the Introduction. These were
made by verbs of the first conj. whose supines end in -citum and by verbs of
the fourth conj. whose supines end in ddum. A few irregularities among
these conis. perhaps deserve a passing notice. Db makes the same sets
of homonyms as the other verbs of the first conj„ except that its a-vowel
is short where theirs is long. Itum (from εὖ), on the other hand, with
like shortening of its vowel in the sup. and scite? scite, with shortened
vowel in the impv.‚ do not act like audi5, since, with other similarly spelled
forms of the pres. of eo* and pf. pt. of sciff, they form homographs only.
The compounds of -cz'cJ, as accio‘, exci5, etc„ in their coinciding forms may
be regarded as following audica Such a pt. as excitus may be regarded
as from the second conj. verb ciffi, and accordingly will not form any coin-
cidences with its own pres. Ρᾱίο· is unique in forming homonym-groups
with the forms p0'l5‚ po‘ta‘s, po‘ta'. Such forms as pfftdtz's, po‘tdte, or peita'tc? on
the other hand fail to find any echo in the pt. po‘tus, although they can
coincide with forms of the alternative pt. pfftcitus.
