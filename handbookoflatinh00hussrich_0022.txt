xviii INTRODUCTION

mutes, ph, clz, tlz, were closely like the corresponding surds,
p, c, t, bs was like ps. But these and various other rare· corn·
binations merely give rise to a varied spelling of the same word ς
eg„ caelum, Μῶφι,- trophaeum, tropZum. They do not pro-
duce any homophones, at least in the literary language}
Consequently, for all practical purposes Latin may be regarded
as a phonetically spelled language, and the presence in it of
homophones may be safely denied.

But, although homophones do not appear in Latin, such is
not the case with homographs. The latter are frequent and
form interesting groups. A pair of such Latin homographs,
though they have the same spelling, always differ in the quan-
tity of one or more of their vowels. An example would be
parere, ‘to produce‚' and pc'erre, ‘to obey' 3 or sedZs, ‘you
sit,' and deZs, ‘ seat.’ These differences in quantity (although
much neglected by moderns in their pronunciation of Latin)
were without doubt carefully brought out by the Romans.
F ailure to distinguish in this way hoinographs that differ in the
quantity of the ultima or the antepenult‚ is a serious error.
Much worse is it, however, when the quantity of the penult
syllable is concerned 5 for it may then, in addition to a false
quantity, give rise to a false accent.2

1 If there had been many homophones in Latin, the puns that they would
have caused could not have failed of record. Such a vulgarism as confusing
εσσε and quoque might have been used by Cicero for making a pun of rather
poor quality, but could not have been employed by him in serious oratory (in
agendb), Quintil. VI. 3, 47.

2 Some Latin teachers who have spent decades in their profession do not
correctly differentiate cupid& from cupidb. It would be interesting to find out
how many surely know which it is, and what difference it makes, whether it is
athZrz's or abiteris, that is found at the opening of Cicero's First Catiline.
