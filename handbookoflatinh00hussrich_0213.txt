APPENDIX 1 77

In the second conj. a few verbs whose supines end in ·Ztum give rise to two
pairs of homonyms and one pair of homographs, as amc? or audi5 do. An
example of this would be the words delete, α’ἑίέίὸ, and diletis (ds) from α’ἑίεό.
Causea, another second conj, verb, is peculiar in allowing a coincidence
between its present impV. (censi) and the voc. sing. m. of its pf. pt. (cense).

In the third conj. a small group of verbs with sups. in -z'tum or in ilum
coincide as often as auditi Thus credff, which has a sup. in -itum‚ makes
two pairs of homonyms and one pair of homographs‚ as in cridz'te, ενέιίἰίό,
and creditis (-z's). When the sup. ends in -z‘tum then not merely the last
pair, but all three pairs are homographs; as in petite petz-le, petits? petz‘th,
petitis petz-tls. Two -ίό verbs of the third conj. also allow three coinci-
dences. One of thern, cupi5‚ follows the usage of pet& .· the other, dicia,
forms its coincidences after the manner of crido‘. ’

PERFECT AND SUPINE SYSTEMS

There is but a single place where the perfect and supine systems can
have coinciding forms. This is where the ending is -ἷ. There must also
be another condition, namely, that the two systems have the same stem.
An instance is clausi, pf. ind. act„ and clausi, gen. sing. m. and n., and
nom. pl. m. of the pf. pt. of clauda. Verbs that allow this coincidence
must have a perfect stem in s or t,· for these are the only endings that a
supine stem will admit. Usually they are third conj. verbs, like claud5,
having an s-pf. The t-pfs. are limited to a few compounds of sz'st5 and
sto‘. The -z'o‘ group of the third conj. supplies but a single verb qualia? (in
the compounds -cussi) that makes this coincidence between pf. and sup.
system. The second and fourth conjs. supply each a few such verbs ς as,
for example, iube& and sentiff. The first conj. does not exhibit any.
