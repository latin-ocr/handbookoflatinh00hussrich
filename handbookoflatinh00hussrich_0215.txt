APPENDIX 1 79

relegit (pfl), defended by Bentley in Hor. E. 2, 69, is a vl. taken from
inferior MSS. Keller (Epileg.) thinks that the archetype had redbgit. To
this, he concludes, a gloss colligit was added and from this latter relbgit
naturally descended. —The preS. relegit is found in Tac. A. II. 54.

repetitf), fut. impv. act.‚ is an emendation of Fleckeisen in Ter. Ph. 664
for the MS. petita Itis approved by Dziatzko and with some doubt by
Spengel. —As a pf. pt. repetito* is found in Tac. A. III. 33 and VI. 5.

trfinsmISsum‚ as acc. of a 4th decl. noun, is retained by Holder and
other editors of Caes. in G. V. 2. Nipperdey strikes it out as a gloss on

the neighboring noun traiectum—As pf. pt. tminsmz‘ssum occurs in Tae.
A. IV. 21, XVI. 12, and in Liv. XXII. 20, 7.

vade, abl. of vcis, is supplied to the text without MS. authority by Mad-
vig in Cic. Sest. 19, and the change is approved by Kayser as necessary to
the sense.—As an impv., va'de is found in Hor. Epi. Ι. 13, 19.

vades, fut. ind. act. of vddo‘, is a conjecture of Usener and Dziatzko
followed by Ribbeck in Verg. Cul. 380 for various MS. readings among
which is vddz's the pres.—- Vadbs from vtis is found in Sall. J. 35, 9 and in
Tac. A. I. 60, V. 8. — Vadis from va'dum is found in Hor. E. 16, 26 and
frequently in Verg.

verris and vellis are variants of as early a date as the Pseudoakron in
Hor. S. ΙΙ. 3, 235. Bentley prefers the former, but doubtfully. Keller
also thinks that it suits the meaning better because ‘ you sweep' can refer
very properly to fishing with a net. He finds it however in the Mss. of
his class HL, while vellis is in classes I. and IL—-As gen. sing. of verris
‘ boar‚’ the word is found in Hor. C. 111. 22, 7.
