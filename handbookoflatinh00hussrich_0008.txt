iv PREFACE

single form or a very few forms for each word, would afford
only an imperfect means of discovering the homonyms of the
language. Examining the nominative singular of nouns and
the first person present indicative of verbs, we should arrive at
but very few of the homonyms that Latin possesses. Yet these
are often the only forms given in Latin dictionaries. Working
in this way, we should never find such groups of homonyms as
are made by the words cz‘cstbdi, matare-z, pz'cgnds, statuam, or
verris. The only method of discovering the existence of such
homonyms in a Latin author is to consider the entire range of
his vocabulary.

In the Latin that has come down to us, by no means every
word is completely inflected. This is, of course, largely due
to accident. But an author may also use one member of a
group of homonyms while he consciously avoids the others.
Again it may happen from some cause that all the members are
unused and, in so far, imaginary. These two kinds, the (1)
incomplete and the (2) unused groups, should evidently not
be placed in the same list with groups of homonyms whose use
is thoroughly established.

This is not because they would be altogether valueless to the
student of Latin. A list of the words that an author might
employ‚ but does not make use of, may be of considerable
interest. What he avoids is almost as instructive as what he
chooses. But the two lists should certainly not be merged.

Therefore, beginning at p. 1 in this book, a separate list has
been made of the instances where one of a possible pair of
homonyms occurs in actual use, but lacks its counterpart.
These incomplete, or unmated‚ homonyms are put at the lower
part of the page and described in the briefest manner possible.
