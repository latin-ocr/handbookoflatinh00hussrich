XVi INTRODUCTION

than are the pure homonyms just given. Thus, to instance a
set of homophones, fane is from Latin fanum, fain from Anglo-
Saxon saegen, and feign from Latin fing‘o‘. The homograph
slozzgh, ‘ a mire‚' comes from Celtic 3 but slouglz, ‘ a cast skin,'
from some Germanic source.

In other instances, all the members of a group of homonyms
may be derived from one ancestral language. Thus the various
meanings of port (demeanor, harbor, gate, a wine) come more
or less directly from the Latin words portare, portus, and porta.
The various meanings of ear, ‘organ of hearing,' ‘head of
grain‚' ‘ to plough,’ are from different Anglo-Saxon words. Bay,
‘a color‘ 3 hay, ‘a division of a wall’ 3 bay, ‘an inlet’ 3 and hay,
‘ a barking‚’ are from different Latin words. The homophones
too and two are from Anglo-Saxon 3 vain and vein are from
Latin. The homographs νηοῖο, ‘to cut3' and νηοῖο, ‘a heap‚'
are of Anglo-Saxon origin.

The other Germanic languages as compared with English
are relatively free from homonyms. They have, in the first
place, less intermixture and assimilation of foreign words. Be-
sides this, they have to a greater degree than English a trait
that was also possessed by Latin and Greek, — phonetic spelling.
That is, they usually render the same sound by the same letter
or the same combination of letters. Sein, ‘his3’ and sein, ‘to ,
be ' 3 der Bauer, das Bauer ,· and der T rag, er trag, are com·
mon homonyms from German. Homophones are exemplified
by mehr, Meam Seite, Saite ,· and heute, Hc'z‘ute,· and homo-
graphs by a shift of accent, as in einmdl and einmal.

French and, to a less extent, the other Romance languages
show the effect of considerable assimilation. This has taken
place both in sound and spelling during their descent from
