INTRODUCTION xxvii

From the point of view of classic Latin they are distinctly
independent words,

Another frequent change from one part of speech to another
consists in the'use of an adjective, noun, or pronoun as an
adverb. In English this transfer can be seen in far and daily,
the adjectives 3 in why and that, the pronouns 3 and in post,
the noun (in such a phrase as ‘to travel post '). Latin
examples of this change to an adverb would be exterum, ᾳῑιῡ,
and curriculb. The accusative singular neuter of the adjective
is indeed the only form used in making the adverb of the com-
parative degree (celerius, ‘ faster '). In the positive degree the
adverb is more variously formed. The ablative of the adjec-
tive, as, eg„ cerffi, is very commonly used. Many adverbs
from nouns and pronouns are also rnade in this way, as forte,
qub. F ewer adverbs, but certain ones of very frequent occur-
rence, are made from the accusative, as multum, filcile. This
usage extends also into the superlative degree (as, eg„ in pri-
mum), but here the ablative (as in primb) is about as common.

The converse change from an adverb to an adjective¹ may
also be traced in Latin3 as, for example, in the phrases, si
valEs bene est or eri semper ίὲηίίᾱς. It can be paralleled in
English by ‘ often infirmities.’

Besides the changes already mentioned, Latin exhibits several
others more rare and accidental. One of these is the change
from an adjective or noun to a preposition. An example of
this would be secundum, circum, or cause} in Latin, or round
and midst in English. The change of a noun, adjective, or
pronoun to a conjunction is another transfer. Modo, ciderunt,
erum, or quod would represent this in Latin, and English
examples would be the pronoun that and the adJective belle.
