So familiar are they that their various coincidences are illustrated by merely
a single example of some typical Latin word. A few coincidences owing to
their rarity have not been inserted in this outline. They are explained in
Appendix A„ pp. 173—177. As far as they are found in actual use, they are also
given in the regular list of homonyms that begins on p. 1.
