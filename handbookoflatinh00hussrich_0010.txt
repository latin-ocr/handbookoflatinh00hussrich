Class III. (described on pp. xxix-xxxi) , where the homonyms
are derived from different stems or roots, is listed in its entirety.
This class forms the larger part of the whole list and by far
its most important part.

One member of a group of homonyms may be some very com-
mon word. Then only its first few occurrences are referred to in
the list. The remaining ones are denoted by the sign -μ, In case
the word is rarely used the references given are exhaustive, pro-
vided they are less than six or eight in the author considered.

The complete works of each author have been examined
for homonyms, except in the case of Cicero and Livy. For
Cicero the field comprises the orations only, and for Livy the
earlier books (Ι. to XXII.). The rest of these two authors,
except very small portioris of Cicero, are much more rarely
read. To insert the homonyms contained in them would
seem to justify taking into consideration Ovid, Plautus, and
others, and extending the book beyond intended limits.

In the case of most of the authors, the references are made

to their books in the order in which these usually stand in com-
plete editions. Thus the references to Caesar come first from

the Gallie War,· then from the Cz'm'l, Alexandrine, African,
and Spanz'slz in the order named. In Cicero, Vergil, and Taci-
tus, however, the references are taken from their works in the
order in which these are customarily read. Thus in Cicero the
references given come first from the four Catilines, then from
the Archias and Manilian Law, and finally from the other
orations in their order as usually edited. The references to
Vergil begin with the Aeneid, and go then to the shorter poems 3
those of Tacitus begin with the shorter works, and afterward go
to the Annals and Histories.
