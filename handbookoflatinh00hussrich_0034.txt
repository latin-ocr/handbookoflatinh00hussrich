XXX INTRODUCTION

incidb, ‘ I fall in’ 3 or ιἰἳς, ‘ right‚' and ists, ‘ gravy.' All the forms
of one of these words will then have corresponding forms in the
other.1

When the stem-endings or inflections are different, coin-
cidences in form are much more restricted. This holds true
whether the homonyms are from the same root, like the words
spelled lmnestc‘zs, or from different roots‚ like those spelled
malis. Coincidences among such homonyms can occur only
in certain special lines where the same endings happen to be
found. This similarity of ending is found between words of the

First and second declension in -α, as in pz‘la ,· -drum, as in avd‘rum ,· and
-z‘s, as in pilis.

First and third declension in -α, as in 0‘7'a,· «rrum, as in iubarum (iuba-
rum) ,· -2“s‚ as in mbnsz's,· and -ᾱς, as in honestds.

Second and third declension in ·2cs‚ as in lcitus (latus) ‚· -er, as in uter,-
-um‚ as in dechrum (decorum) ,· -ῖ, as in decc5m'; -ᾶ, as in εᾱνᾶ (εανό ) ,·
-ε, as in mileu· -α, as in (lecara (decora); -ᾶνιιηι, as in condz‘tbrum:
-is, as in qzcz‘btz‘s (quiitis) ‚· and -o‘s, as in colo-s.

Second and fourth declension in -us, as in dctus ,· and -um, as in ciclum.

Second and fifth declension in -ἷ, as in νεῖ,· and -e‚ as infide (fida).

Third and fourth declension in -zcs‚ as in acus ,· -um, as in partum,· and
-z'bzcs, as in manibus (manibus).

Third and fifth declension in -ἒς, as in fidi’sf -em, as in fidem ,· and -e‚ as

in fide (fide).

1 Some peculiar homonyms formed by the prefix in· and by the suffix -que
also correspond in this way.

ln· is used with participles, (1) in the same sense as the preposition in, or
(2) with the meaning ⁴ not.' In this way there may arise pairs of homonyms in
which one member of the pair is of almost opposite meaning to the other; as„
indicens, ‘ declaring,’ and indicbns, ⁴ not declaring.’

The suffix -que is attached, with a distributive meaning, to interrogative pro-
nouns anda few other words. The same suffix may also have the meaning
‘ and! Pairs of homonyms can thus be formed by whatever words allow this
-que to be attached to them in either of its senses. Such a pair is, e.g.‚ cuique„
meaning ‘to each,' and cuique, meaning ‘and to whom!
