PRONOUNS

In pronouns and pronominal adjectives there are various other duplica·
tions in form besides those outlined in the Introduction, pp. xxi-xxii, under
the head of adjectives and pronouns. These exceptional cases of coinci-
dence have also been inserted in the Alphabetical List. This will account
for the presence in this list of such forms as, nlelz‘, dat. sing, and milli,
nom. pl. m.; mk, the acc.‚ and υιέ, the abl. sing.; sibzss the dat. sing„ and
sz‘bff, the dat. pl.; quae, the nom. sing. f.‚ nom, ace. pl. n., and quae, the
nom. pl. f.; Ιιᾶε, nom. and acc. sing. n., and Ιιᾶε, abl. sing. m. and n.
These are instances where pronouns vary from the declension of the
standard adjectives. They are of course very common words, but they
have been entered in the list as being practically isolated instances of
duplication‚ or as being peculiar to only a very few pronouns. Like these
pronouns in their isolation are ambe? and du5,· so that a few coincidences
peculiar to these two adjectives have been also listed.
