be caused by contrasting two homographs in the same way.
The recognition of the special kind of words that form these
figures is the only point of interest. The figures themselves
are of little importance. They are nothing more than an
effort to juggle with the materials of language. Quintilian in
criticising these passages quoted from the Auctor rightly says
(IX. 3, 69), ebrumque exempla vitandi potius quam imitanfi
grc'z‘tid pana.

In treating the subject of ambiguity, Quintilian notices that
some words can be divided into pieces‚ and still retain some
meaning.1 ⁶As Latin examples of such words he gives ingenua,
amndmentmn, incultb, and others. These are, however, not at
all ambiguous in our printed texts. They become so only
when written in the ancient way, without spacing of words,
or when read in a monotone.

HOMONYMS IN ENGLISH AND IN KINDRED MODERN
LANGUAGES

Before considering in detail the homonyms of Latin, it may
be useful to examine this feature in English and incidentally
in some other languages. For, as regards the formation of
homonyms, the classic languages exhibit poverty beside the
richness of F rench and English. In these languages not only
is each class of homonyms more fully represented, but the
sources of the homonyms themselves are more interestingly

1 Thus the Greek words αὐλητρὶς πεσοῦσα may also be read in the form αὐλὴ
τρὶς πεσοῦσα, a piece of ingenuity which, it is thought, dates back to Zeno the
Stoic (Diog. Laert. 7, 62). Another instance of similar ambiguity, but lacking
the famous ancestry, was the bequest that read, ταμαπανταλεοντι. When the
spacing of words was not yet in vogue, this left it in doubt whether the property
was willed to Leon or to Pantaleon.
