INTRODUCTION xi

The term homonym is thus explained by Aristotle in the
opening sentence of his first book (Cat. 1): Ὁμώνυμα λέγεται
ὧν ὄνομα μόνον κοινόν, ὁ δὲ κατὰ τοῦνομα λόγος τῆς οὐσίας ἔτερος,
οἷον ζῷον ὅ τε ἅνθρωπος καὶ τὸ γεγραμμένον, τούτων γὰρ ὄνομα
μόνον κοινόν, ὃ δὲ κατὰ τοῦνομα λόγος τῆς οὐσίας ἕτερος· ἂν γάρ
τις ἀποδιδῷ τί ἐστιν αὐτῶν ἑκατέρῳ, τό ζῴῳ εἶναι, ἴδιον ἑκατέρου
λόγον ἀποδώσει.-“Ηοῐῐιοι]γτῃε are defined as objects which
have only their name in common, but the definition of their
real substance different, as for instance, ζῴον denotes man and
a picture (of one). Of these the name only is common 3 but
the definition of the real substance is different. If a person
attaches to each of thern the quality that makes it a ζῴον, he
will attach its proper definition to each.'’

ὄνομα κοινὸν καὶ ὁ κατὰ τοῦνομα λόγος τῆς οὐσίας ὃ αὐτός, οἷον
ζῴον ὅ τε ἅνθρωπος καὶ ὃ βοῦς. - “ Synonyms are defined as ob-
J'ects which have their name in common, and of which the defi-
nition of the real substance is the same: as ζῴον denotes man
and ox.”

In these rather formal definitions‚ Aristotle is regarding
homonyms and synonyms as objects and not as mere words.
'Synonyms consequently appear to him as different objects
comprised under one class-name. Homonyms, on the other
hand, are objects having the same name but not belonging to
the same class. Man and ox are synonyms, because they come
under the same class-name of animal. Man and his picture
are homonyms, because they do not belong structurally in the
same class of objects, although in Greek they have the same
name, ζῷον In another passage, Aristotle says in further illus-
