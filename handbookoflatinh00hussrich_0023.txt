I. HOMONvMs FORMED ΒΥ THE INFLECTION OF A SINGLE WORD

In the sense in which the word homonym is used in modern
languages, it is usually understood that each member of a group
of homonyms comes from a different root. This limitation in
the meaning of the word could also be carried out in Latin.
But in a discussion that aims to cover, to a degree, all the
phases of the subject, it seems better at first to understand the
word in its widest sense. By this means there can be taken
into consideration two new classes (L, II.) which would other-
wise have to be omitted. One of these classes (Ι.) comprises
homonyms which are derived from the same word. These
may, of course, differ, as nouns in case or number 3 as adjec-
tives and pronouns in case, number, or gender 3 or as verbs
in person, tense, mood, or voice. In short, the definition of
homonym as thus extended includes such forms of the same
word as are duplicated in the course of its inflection. Examples
of these coinciding forms are found scattered through all the
regular declensions and conjugations, as follows :—
