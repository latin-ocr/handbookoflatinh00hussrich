III. HOMONYMS DERIVED FROM DIFFERENT STEMS oR Roors

In class ΙΙΙ. the members of any group of homonyms must
necessarily come from different stems, although their root may
be the same. Whenever they are derived in this way from the
same root, they will all have a kindred meaning. This is
shown in the three senses of ‘honor,’ ‘honorable‚’ and ‘you
honor,' that are attached to the group of homonyms spelled
honestas. Another instance of homonyms of kindred meaning
is shown in decbr} from decor, decbr} from decbrzcs, and decori
from decus. Quite a number of small families of homonyms
are thus formed from a single root. A set of three members,
as in the examples just cited, is, however, much less frequent
than a group of two.

When each member of a group of homonyms comes from a
different root, there is much greater difference in their meanings.
An example of this from English would be cleave, or lay, or in
fact any of the homonyms mentioned on page xvii. An illus-
tration from Latin would be malis, ‘bad‚' mc‘zlis, ‘you may
prefer,’ mdszs, ‘cheeks,' and mc‘zlis, ‘ masts.' When homonyms
show such different meanings as these, it seems to be owing to
accidental likenesses among their roots. Fortunately, these
homonyms are more rare than the other kinds we have dis-
«cussed. But they are also the most important for the reader
to recognize. To mistake one of them for another, when they
have so different senses, completely distorts the meaning of a
passage in which they may be used.

In this class III. some homonyms may happen to have the
same stem—ending and inflection, though coming from different
roots. An example of this would be incida, ‘I cut in,’ and
