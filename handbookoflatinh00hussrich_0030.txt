xxvi INTRODUCTION

‘goods,' prbmissa, ‘promises,’ propinquus, ‘relative,' diva,
‘ goddess,' amicus, ‘friend'

In other instances the meaning of the derivative noun does
not come so simply from the adjective. .The notion of man,
woman, or thing, primarilyv suggested by the gender of the
noun, is not enough. In changing to a noun the adjective
has received some more remote or peculiar noun—idea. Thus
with fera the noun bestia seems to be implied, with pauca
the noun verba, with rZ’gz'a the noun domus, and with patria
the word terra. ’

Instances where, conversely, a noun is used as an adjective,
are much more rare. Examples of this usage are lupi raptb-rZs
or victor exercitus. This use is so uncommon that, in fact, it
becomes a figure of speech rather than a regular form of
expression. Although usually found in poetry or in passages
of poetic coloring, the second example of the two just given
is from the prosaic Caesar.

The derived noun (or adjective) that was discussed in the
last two paragraphs had the same set of forms as the word from
which it came. In some instances‚ however, the derived word
has taken on a different nominative. This is seen on com-
paring the nouns, animal and cb‘gnbmen, with their correspond-
ing adjectives, anima-illle and c5g725minz's. These pairs have the
same stem, and in all cases except the nominative and accusa-
tive singular the noun coincides with the neuter of the adjective.
The two nouns, malus, ‘ apple tree,' and malum, ‘ apple,' have
a similar relation to each other. Leaving aside the question
of priority between such words, the fact seems to remain that
they separated at an earlier stage in the formation of the
language than those words which have the same nominative.
