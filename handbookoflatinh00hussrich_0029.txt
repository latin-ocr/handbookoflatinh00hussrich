ΙΙ. HOMONYMS THAT ARE DIFFERENT WoRDs BUT DERrvED
FROM THE SAME STEM

Another class of homonyms is that in which each member of
a group is derived from the same stem but belongs to a dif-
ferent part of speech. English and other modern languages
are as well equipped with this sort of homonym as Latin.
Brown, a color 3 brown, possessing that color 3 brawa, to make
have that color3 pouvoz'r, le pozcvoir; das Bz'tten, wir bilsen,-
gut, ‘ good,' gut, ‘well,’ Gnt, ‘ estate,' are examples of modern
words thus derived from the same stem.

In Latin, homonyms of this sort would be adversus, the
participle ‘ opposite,' and adversus, the preposition and adverb
‘against’ ; malum, the adjective ‘bad,' malum, the noun
‘badness,' and malum, the interjection ‘the deuce' 3 causa,
the noun ‘ cause‚’ and causei, the preposition ‘ on account of ' 3
commodum, the adjective ‘convenient,' and commodum, the
adverb ‘just now.'

A frequent change of this sort, from one part of speech to
another, takes place whenever an adjective is used as a noun
or pronoun. Although this is common enough in English
(where it is found in such phrases as, ‘ tlte geon? ‘ tlze many,'
‘ a sollowz'ng’)‚ it is still more widely used in Latin. In many
cases we can arrive at the meaning of the noun thus formed by
supplying to the meaning of the adjective the concepts, man,
woman, or thing, according as the gender of the derivative
noun is masculine, feminine, or neuter. Thus, by knowing the
meaning of the participle or adjective, we arrive easily at the
meaning of ηᾶίῑις, ‘ son,' ηᾶία, ‘ daughter,’ praeficias, ‘leader‚’
factum, ‘deed,’ dicrbtum, ‘decree,' z'zissa, ‘commands,' bona,
