their parent Latin speech. Thus son from Latin suus, son from
Latin sonus, and son, ‘ bran,‘ from Latin summus (Ρ) have
come to coincide in F rench. These form a set of pure homo-
nyms. Homographs like fils from filius, and fils from filum,
or vis from vivb, and vis from vitis, show like assimilations. As
long as Latin retained its inflectional endings and its almost
completely phonetic spelling, it was necessarily less rich than
F rench in homonyms of all kinds. Latin is, for instance, utterly
unable to furnish such a group of homophones 3 as the F rench
words, lai, laid, laz'e, laz't, ίέ, legs, les, and lez ,· as, cez'rzs, ceint,
cinq, sain, saint, sein, seing, sin ,· or as, vair, ver, verre, vers,
and vert.

Modern Greek has also a large number of homophones that
are not found in the ancient language. These have been pro-
duced, however, not so much by silencing consonants after the
manner of French‚ as by assimilating the sounds of several
vowels and diphthongs. In this way, η, ι, υ, ει, υι, οι have come
to represent but a single sound, that of English long e. Con-
sequently, such ancient Greek words as, εἵη, ἵει, ἴη, ἵοι οἴει, οἵη,
οἷι, ὕει, υἴει, υἷι, ὕοι would all be homophones in the modern

speech.
HOMONYMS IN LATIN

As previously stated, Latin spelling was almost completely
phonetic. No languages have a spelling entirely so. In all
of them some letters or letter-combinations are found whose
sounds are very similar or even exactly the same. Yet, as far
as the pronunciation of Latin can now be determined, there
were very few such cases among its elementary sounds. Much
alike in sound were e and ei, and ae seems to have coincided
with them from the Augustan period onward. The aspirated
