T he declensions of adjectives and participles are the same as
the first three declensions of nouns. The masculine and neuter
genders always follow the second or third declension. The
feminine generally follows the first. In all cases, however,
any one gender always holds to a single declension. Con-
sequently within any one gender the coincidences in form are
never more numerous than those of a similarly declined noun
of one of the first three declensions.

The following additional coincidences are found on compar*
ing the different genders of adjectives with one another: —
