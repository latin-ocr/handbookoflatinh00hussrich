PREFACE vii

In making these lists of homonyms, it may be that the search
for thern has been carried over rarely read parts of authors, but
if this is so it is only to render the lists more scientifically
complete. Valuable corroboration has been gained from the
indexes of Merguet for Cicero and Caesar, of Keller and Holder
for Horace, and of Gerber and Greef for Tacitus. None of
these are without occasional inaccuracies among the large
number of references they contain. Nor can it be hoped that
the present lists are better in this regard. Their maker will

be completely satisfied if errors appear in them in no larger

mCaSUIâ€˜e.
