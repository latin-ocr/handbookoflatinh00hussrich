divergent. Even a very brief examination of English suffices
to show that :—-

1. Some words are homonyms both to the eye and to the
ear. Examples of these would be bear, the verb, and bear, the
noun 3 or cleave, ‘to adhere,’ and cleave, ‘to cut asunder.'

II. Other homonyms may be spelled alike‚ but differ in
pronunciation ,· as, gill, a measure, and gill, part of a fish ;
or lead, the metal, and lead, the verb. A better term to use
for such words is komegraplz. They are especially frequent
in languages, like French and English, where the spelling is
unphonetic.

ΠΙ. Α third class of homonyms is composed of words that
are pronounced alike, but which differ in spelling. Such words
are homonyms to the ear only and not to the eye. These
sound—homonyms, or leontophoneS, are common enough in
English. The words, meat, meet, κείω or rzglzt, rite, wmglzt,
write, are good examples ; and dialect peculiarities or care-
lessness in pronunciation may greatly increase their number.

These various kinds of homonyms have usually arisen by
assimilation to one another of words that were different in
earlier ages. Often also the original words come from widely
separated sources. Thus in a group of English homonyms, one
may be of Celtic origin, one of Teutonic‚ and another may
come from Latin or some other language. An example of this
would be lay, the present tense of one Anglo-Saxon verb, the
past of another, lay, ‘ a song,’ from Old F rench, and lay, ‘ not
clerical,' from Greek. Moor, ‘to fasten,’ comes (probably)
from Dutch, moer, ‘ a plain,' from Anglo-Saxon, and Meor, ‘an
African,' from Greek. Homophones and homographs are even
more likely to be derived in this way from different sources
