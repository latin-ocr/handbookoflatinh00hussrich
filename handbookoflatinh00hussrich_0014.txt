X INTRODUCTION

is because F rench is a language especially replete with these
words. The frequency of silent letters in this language causes
many of its words to have the same sound, although quite a
different spelling.

For English, there is a list of homonyms covering some
pages in the appendix of Professor Skeat’s Etymologz'cal Dic-
tionary. A short list of Latin homographs (one kind of homo-
nym) is given in Bouterwek and Tegge's Altspraclzlz‘che Ortlme-
pie. Otherwise, the subject of homonyms is usually relegated

to articles in encyclopaedias and to stray paragraphs in books
on rhetoric and grammar0

TREATMENT OF HOMONYMS BY GREEK AND LATIN
WRITERS

The present scarcity of literature upon the subject of homo-
nyms is certainly not caused by any lack of recognition of
these words in antiquity‚ nor because the word homonyme is of
recent origin. In the Homeric poems the two Ajaxes are called
“ homonyms '’ of each other. Plato employs the word several
times to denote things having the same name. With him
rcomes also the added meaning of false representation, as in
the words, “They are imitations and homonyms of the things
‘that really exist '’ (Sepla. 234 B).

The adjective synonymous (συνώνυμος), not found in Homer
-or Plato, seems to occur first in the tragic poets. In them it
has the same sense as its brother word ὁμώνυμος. Aristotle,
however, who carefully defines the two terms, finds a consider-
able difference between them. Yet with him the two are such
favorite words that in his frequent use of thern he does not
always hold himself strictly bound by his own definitions.
