B. HOMONYMS OF QUESTIONABLE AUTHENTICITY
IN ONE OF THEIR MEANINGS

aequissume, voe. sing. m., is an emendation of Fleckeisen followed by
Dziatzko for the MS. agissz'me in line 12 (993) of the spurious conclusion
of the Andria of Ter. —The adv. aequissim? occurs in Cic. Verr. III. 147.

altitudine in Sall. H. IV. 55 is understood by Dietsch as a dat„ but is
better taken by Maurenbrecher as an abl. It is found in the phrase scdlds
parbs moenium altitzzdz'ne quoted from Sall. by Arusianus to illustrate the
construction pa‘r heic νέ. Being an abl. itself, it of course ceases to be a
homonym of this case.

assedimus, as a verb of the second conj. in Cic. Cluent. 141, is an error
found only in Kayser's text for the MS. assedissemus. —As a form of the
third conj. from assidb the word occurs in Cic. Verr. IV. 138.

clare, voc. sing. m. in Hor. C. Ι. 20, 5, is defended by Bentley, though
it is the reading of very inferior Mss. Keller and Holder and most other
editors keep ca're.— Clare, the adv., occurs in Caes. C. ΙΙΙ. 94, in Cic.
Verr. ΙΙ. 94, III. 69, Sulla 31, and in Ter. And. 754.

colligant, as pres. subj., is an alteration made by Nipperdey in an
inferior reading colligent of Caes. C. II. 31. Better MSS. have concilient,
which is retained by most editors, including Holder and Du Pontet.--
Colligam, as pres. ind., is found in Nep. Dion 9, 4.

decrevisse, from α’ἑινὲπᾶ, is an emendation of Kayser in Cic. Sest. 69
for the MS. crevisse. Mommsen suggests dbfuisse.—-De³crc³visse, from
decerno] is found in Sall. J. 109, 3, in Cic. Verr. ΙΙ. 174, ÷ (3), and in
Tac. A. IV. 43.

immutatum, pf. pt. of immam meaning ‘ changed‚’ is Halm's ci. for the
Medicean ramatdtum and the matritum of other Mss. in Tac. H. ΙΙ. 100.
Heraeus does not adopt this, preferring commzitdtum.—Immzitdtum, as
an adj. meaning ⁶ unchanged‚’ occurs in Ter. And. 242.

invisis, ‘ unseen‚’ is all that is made by Nipperdey out of the MS. invi-
sislatitatz's of Caes. C. II. 4. Elberling followed by Holder and Du Pontet
finds invisitcitz's and there are numerous other conjectures.—As pt. of
invida, ‘ hated,' the word is found in Hor. S. II. 3, 262.
